#### Q: 
- What is Monolith Architecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Architecture (use cases and benefits)
#### A: 
- A monolith architechture is an architecture where the frontend, backend and database are in one system. A 2-tier archtecture splites the front-end from the backend and database. Microservices splits each of them into smaller services.
e.g. you may want to use a monolith for smaller projects that don't require frequent changes as it is easier to implements and less time consuming. Microservices will be important for large projects that have a large impact on a business, such as loss of money.
